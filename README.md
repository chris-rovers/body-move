# body-move README

A simple extension that allows the user to enter an amount of minutes in which they would like to be reminded to get up, stretch, take a walk or exercise. Being a developer involves a lot of sitting and it's important to stand up and move!

## Features

User can enter a number value to set the amount of minutes to wait before triggering the reminder.
A pop-up will briefly display the value back to them.
A persistent message in the status bar will display what time the next reminder is due to trigger.
The status bar message updates after the reminder fires and a new reminder is set.

## Requirements

Just the will to get up and move, when reminded.
